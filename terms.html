            The Service is provided on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis, without warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Bourbon Hunter disclaims all warranties, including any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, quiet enjoyment, non‑infringement, and any warranties arising out of course of dealing or usage of trade. We do not warrant that the Service will be uninterrupted, secure, or error‑free, that any defects will be corrected, or that the Service will meet your expectations or requirements.

          <p class="text-sm md:text-base text-gray-300 font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">
            To the fullest extent permitted by law, in no event will Bourbon Hunter or its affiliates, licensors, partners, or service providers, or their respective owners, directors, officers, employees, or agents, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages, or for any loss of profits, revenues, data, goodwill, or other intangible losses, arising out of or in connection with your access to or use of (or inability to access or use) the Service, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability, or any other legal theory, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.
          </p>
          <p class="text-sm md:text-base text-gray-300 font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">
            To the fullest extent permitted by law, Bourbon Hunter’s total aggregate liability for any claim arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Service will be limited to the greater of (a) the amount you have paid to us, if any, for access to the Service during the six (6) months immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim, or (b) one hundred U.S. dollars (USD $100).
          </p>
          <p class="text-sm md:text-base text-gray-300 font-light leading-relaxed">
            Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages or warranties, so some of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to you. In such cases, the liability of Bourbon Hunter will be limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

            We may suspend or terminate your access to the Service, in whole or in part, at any time and for any reason, including if we reasonably believe that you have violated these Terms, engaged in fraudulent or abusive behavior, or pose a risk of harm to other users or to Bourbon Hunter. Upon termination, the rights and licenses granted to you under these Terms will immediately cease, and your right to use the Service will end.
          </p>
          <p class="text-sm md:text-base text-gray-300 font-light leading-relaxed">
